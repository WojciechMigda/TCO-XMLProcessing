/*
 * Employed XML parser produces output which for each tag found in the input
 * has statistics as follows:
 * - tag count, e.g. how many times that tag occurs in the input
 * - attribute counts, that is number of unique occurences of each attribute
 *   that was present in the given tag.
 * - children tags count, that is number of unique occurences of each child
 *   tag.
 *
 * With the above it is possible to distiguish between attributes and child tags
 * whether they are required (always preset) or not.
 * For instance if for a given atttribute or child tag its count equals
 * tag count then such element is required. If it is less then that means that
 * it was not always present, hence, it is not required.
